Granny!!! Now-a-days all the applications are working automatically whether it is a robot, car, refrigerator, X-ray scanning used in the airport or any software which we use in our daily lives. Do you know how those all applications work? what are the methods used behind their automaticity? The reason behind it is Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is most popular and trending in todays world. AI creates the machines to work intelligently and to do the time consuming work. The devices such as Alexa, Siri and many other devices works smartly with the help of AI. AI uses Machine Learning (ML) which is basically a subset of AI and consists of more advanced techniques and models that can enable computers to figure things out from the given or input data by humans and delivers AI applications. Machine Learning is commonly used alongside AI but they are not same. ML is the algorithm used to find patterns in the data without the programmer having to explicitly program these patterns. Basically ML refers to the system that can learn by themselves and get smarter and smarter over time without human intervention. It is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through its experience. Now, ML to work automatically it takes help of its subset that is Deep Learning (DL), which uses multi-layered artificial neural networks such as our brain uses neurons and neural network to work, to deliver high accuracy in tasks such as speech recognition, translation, etc. In ML, there are three different types of learning algorithm which are categorised as follows;

1. Surpervised Learning: In this the algorithm is trained on human labeled data. The more samples you provide a supervised learnig algorithm, the more precise it becomes in classifying new data. It                          makes the machine to learn explicitly and the feedback is given directly. It also resolves regression and classification problems.identify

2. Unsurpervised Learning: It relies on giving the algorithm unlabeled data and letting it find patterns by itself. In this, you provide the input but not the labels, and let the machine infer                            qualities. Here, the machine understands the data, identifies patterns or structures and gives indirect feedback. 

3. Reinforcement Learning: It relies on providing a ML algorithm with a set of rules and letting it learn how to acheive its goals. In this, the machine learns how to act in a certain emvironment.

Now, lets see where and in which feilds ML is used. ML has various applications which are widely used everyday. 

^  The most common use is in the social media platforms such as the news feed in Instagram, Facebook suggesting users you may know, your interests, etc, Google photos recognising faces of your        friends and family members, Pinterst idetifying the objects and extracting information from te images and recommends similar images or pins.
^  Amazon services also identifies the products you search and buy and suggests similar products through learning and extracting the information which we provide.
^  ML is also used in search engines and improves the search results for you.
^  As I said earlier , Alexa, Siri, Google also uses ML in finding information, refining the information on the basis of previous information received by us and utilises this information to render    the results. 

So, in short Machine Learning is very similar to our human brain. As our brain receives information, analyzes the sitaution and takes decisions accordingly so as ML, it also analyzes the data using computer algorithm and make intelligent decision based on what it has learned. ML has many such ways which can improve our lives and save our time. It has various applications in our day-to-day life we perhaps have no idea that they are driven by ML.
